A simple game where you have to dodge the raining bullets by either using the arrow keys or the arduino joystick based on what controller settings were selected.

Safety mechanic added where you click either the space bar or the arduino button to destroy the bullets around your player model.

3 Different difficulties are added were they change the starting amount of bullets, the speed at which they come down, and the time in between for the adding of bullets.

The added arduino support allows the joystick and buttons to control the player model and the LED allows to see the usage of the bomb and ending screen.

The added sounds from Tone.js plays a sound when the bomb is used and when the player model is hit from a bullet.


Future Development

For the future, maybe adjust the difficulties to be more enjoyable.
Add different playable players in terms of hp, health, speed, and possibly a different ability.
